This repository contains some handy utility scripts for use with
Evergreen.  They are written against master and kept relatively up to
date with changes there.  They may work with earlier releases of
Evergreen, but we make no guarantees.  In many cases they will need
extensive modifications to work with anything but the most recent
releases or master.

They come with no documentation (other than the comments in the code)
and absolutely no warranty of any kind whatsoever.  You use these at
your own risk, and you assume full responsibility for whatever happens
if you run these including but not limited to nuclear apocalypse.

Several of these scripts use a custom JSONPrefs module in order to
load settings or login information for Evergreen.  This module is
available at:

     http://git.mvlcstaff.org/?p=jason/JSONPrefs.git;a=summary

The scripts generally look for these files in a myprefs.d subdirectory
of the current user's home.  The most common such file is expected to
be named evergreen.json and to contain a JSON object with fields
containing login credentials for Evergreen.  Here is a sample of what
that might look like:

     {
          "username" : "eguser",
          "password" : "egpassword",
          "workstation" : "egworkstation",
          "type" : "staff"
     }

You, of course, replace eguser, egpassword, and egworkstation with the
credentials appropriate to your system.

The parameters.pl script needs a JSON file of properties to get access
to your database server via Perl DBI:

    {
	"database" : "dbname",
	"host" : "hostname",
	"port" : "portnumber",
	"user" : "username",
	"password" : "password"
    }

The host and port parameters are optional if your DBI does not need
them to connect to a database running on the localhost.  For the most
part, I would recommend that you fill them in.

The locations for finding these JSON files is currently hardcoded, but
future development my make it more dynamic.  Patches welcome!
