This repository contains some handy utility scripts for use with
Evergreen.  They are written against master and kept relatively up to
date with changes there.  They may work with earlier releases of
Evergreen, but we make no guarantees.  In many cases they will need
extensive modifications to work with anything but the most recent
releases or master.

They come with no documentation (other than the comments in the code)
and absolutely no warranty of any kind whatsoever.  You use these at
your own risk, and you assume full responsibility for whatever happens
if you run these including but not limited to nuclear apocalypse.

Several of these scripts use a custom JSONPrefs module in order to
load settings or login information for Evergreen.  This module is
available at:

     http://git.mvlcstaff.org/?p=jason/JSONPrefs.git;a=summary

The scripts generally look for these files in a myprefs.d subdirectory
of the current user's home.  The most common such file is expected to
be named evergreen.json and to contain a JSON object with fields
containing login credentials for Evergreen.  Here is a sample of what
that might look like:

     {
          "username" : "eguser",
          "password" : "egpassword",
          "workstation" : "egworkstation",
          "type" : "staff"
     }

You, of course, replace eguser, egpassword, and egworkstation with the
credentials appropriate to your system.

NOTE: I am working on eliminating the above requirements.

The scripts that communicate to the server via the DBI module need to
have the PG database environment variables setup properly.  If you can
connect to the database you want simply by typing psql at the command
line, then you are good to go.  If not, you need to read this:
http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.2/static/libpq-envars.html and set
your environment up appropriately.
